# Prolog in Physics

This is the code that drives the work in the *paper.pdf* article, also posted here.

The prolog code attempts to tell you how to solve a 1D
kinematics problem from a typical introductory physics
course (see text by Knight, etc.).  The problem can only
involve a single object.

It was written to work in [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org), and can be started
by running `phys.pl` with `io.pl` in the same folder.

Once run, you can start up the solver with something like `solve(porsche).`
