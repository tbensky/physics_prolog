# Prolog in Physics

This is the code that drives the work in the paper.pdf article.

The prolog code attempts to tell you how to solve a 1D
kinematics problem from a typical introductory physics
course (see text by Knight, etc.).  The problem can only
involve a single object.

It was written to work in SWI-Prolog, and can be started
using something like solve(porsche).
